PNG Placeholder - 16x16
This is a placeholder for the actual PNG icon.
In a real implementation, you would replace this with an actual PNG file.

To create real PNG icons:
1. Use an image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Create a 16x16 pixel image
3. Design with the Wallapop Filter theme
4. Save as PNG with transparency
5. Replace this file with the actual PNG

For now, Chrome will use a default icon if this file is missing.
